Minor changes(not a priority) :
- relative path to be used
- appearance of manipulator in gazebo
- shift the manipulator on origin


Effort:
- Subtasks


CyberKnife Control:
+ Write simple publisher / subscriber
+ Retrieve joint positions from CyberKnife
- Calculate Jacobian from joint positions
- Calculate inverse kinematics
- Move CyberKnife to point at tumor


CyberKnife Scanning:
- Complete "CyberKnife Control"
- Find out motion path for our end effector
- Similar to homework 5, move the CyberKnife to trace that path


Random Tumor Generation:
+ Write simple publisher / subscriber
- Determine workspace of the robot (or at least a maximum scanning distance)
+ Randomly generate a point for CyberKnife to point to
+ Publish these coords to a topic

+ Create a sphere in URDF
- Place the sphere at the generated coordinates 
  + without gravity


Tumor Position Validation: (stretch goal)
- Attach a LiDAR to the tip of CyberKnife
- Point it along the end effector's Z axis
- Visualize the LiDAR data in RViz
- Ensure that, once tracked, the LiDAR ball stays in one place
